# HTTP Breakout Proxy

**HTTP Breakout Proxy** is a lightweight, cross-platform HTTP/HTTPS interception proxy written in **Go**, with a built-in real-time **web interface** for analyzing and interacting with captured traffic.

It allows you to inspect all HTTP requests and responses exchanged between any two applications â€” ideal for debugging APIs, observing integrations, or reverse-engineering network behavior.
